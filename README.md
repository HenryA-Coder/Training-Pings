# Training-Pings
This is a code for a training pings discord bot. You can create the bot Just for training pings or add it to your other bot. It's based around an LA Fire/EMS FiveM server. It is used to send pings to people who need trainings and they can react to the embed with the automatic "x" or tick.
To run the code you need to open a terminal and type "python bot.py". I coded this bot in VS Code,  all information will be highlighted in green and should come after "#".

__How to install__
1. Download the file 
2. Once you've read both of the .txt files you may/can delete them
3. Create a a new app in the discord developer portal - https://discord.com/developers/applications
4. Once you've created your bot, reset the token then copy it into the code
5. Open the bot.py file in VS Code or any other coding software
6. Fill in all of the required information (BOT Token etc..)
7. Make sure to save the updates
8. Invite the bot to your server 
9. Run the bot through VS Code or your VPS (python bot.py)
